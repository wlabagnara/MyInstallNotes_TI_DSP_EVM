Steps to update GELs for C66x EVMs
----------------------------------

1: There are two GEL files provided in this directory evmc6670l.gel and evmc6678l.gel

2: These GEL files needs to be copied to CCS installation

3: The following steps will assume the CCS is installed in <CCS_INSTALL_DIR> (which is typically C:\Program Files\Texas Instruments\ccsv5 for Windows XP and ~/ti/ccsv5)

4: Close the CCS if open

5: Replace the GEL file present in the <CCS_INSTALL_DIR>/ccs_base/emulation/boards/evmc6670l/gel directory with the evmc6670l.gel file present in this directory

6: Replace the GEL file present in the <CCS_INSTALL_DIR>/ccs_base/emulation/boards/evmc6678l/gel directory with the evmc6678l.gel file present in this directory
