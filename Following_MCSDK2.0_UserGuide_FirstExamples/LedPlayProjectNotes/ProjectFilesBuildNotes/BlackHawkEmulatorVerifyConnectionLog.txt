The IR/DR scan-path tests used 30 frequencies.
The IR/DR scan-path tests used 500.0kHz as the initial frequency.
The IR/DR scan-path tests used 11.75MHz as the highest frequency.
The IR/DR scan-path tests used 10.38MHz as the final frequency.

-----[Measure the source and frequency of the final JTAG TCLKR input]--------

The frequency of the JTAG TCLKR input is measured as 10.37MHz.

The frequency of the JTAG TCLKR input and TCLKO output signals are similar.
The target system likely uses the TCLKO output from the emulator PLL.
