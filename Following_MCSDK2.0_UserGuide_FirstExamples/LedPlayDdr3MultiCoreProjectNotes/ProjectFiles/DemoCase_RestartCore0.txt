NOTES:

1. To each core, starting with Core0
  Connected
  Loaded 'evmc6678l.gel'
  Did 'Scripts->Init Functions->Global_Default_Setup'
  Loaded 'led_play_ddr3_mc.out' build image
  
2. Ran each core starting with Core0 and ending with Core3
3. Set no breakpoints
4. After a little wait, I did a restart on Core0
5. After a short delay I would witness the next core 'start twinkling its LED'
	and the current core#'s 'core# is done.'
